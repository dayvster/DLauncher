## Commit Message Guidelines

All contributions must use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). This helps automate changelogs and makes history easy to understand.

**Format:**

```

**Types:**
- feat: A new feature

- Tag issues appropriately (e.g., bug, enhancement, question).

## Issue Naming & Tagging

- Use clear, descriptive titles for issues (e.g., "Launcher crashes on startup" or "Add dark mode theme").
